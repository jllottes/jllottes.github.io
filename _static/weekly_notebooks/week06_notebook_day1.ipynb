    " * Define and explain any necessary terms (e.g. primes, Fermat's little theorem, prime-like numbers, false primes, etc.).\n",
    " * Include a Markdown cell before each code cell that explains\n",
    "   * What the code does,\n",
    "   * How the code works,\n",
    "   * How it fits into the report (e.g. why are we writing this code?).\n",
    " * Present your exploration in a self-motivated narrative way.\n",
    "   * This includes an Introduction section and a Conclusion section.\n",
    "     * The introduction should get the reader up to speed on the necessary terms and ideas to describe the main topic of exploration, and let the reader know what we will be exploration.\n",
    "     * Observations and conclusions should be made throughout the report as we carry out the exploration and generate data.\n",
    "     * The Conclusion section generally should not include any new information, but should summarize the high-points of the report.\n",
    "    * The report should not refer to \"Exercise 1\" or \"Part 3\" or similar.\n",
    "      * Do not write the report as though you're just ticking the boxes of what's been asked (however true that may or may not be).\n",
    "      * Instead, the various tasks discussed in the project page should come up naturally through the narrative that describes our exploration.\n",
