    "### Text encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to securely send a confidential message one usually needs to encrypt it in some way to conceal its content. Here we consider the following encryption scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    " - One selects a secret key, which is sequence of characters. This key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the message.\n",
    " - Characters of the secret key and characters of the message are converted into ASCII codes. In this way the key is transformed into a sequence of integers $(k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_r)$, and the message becomes another sequence of integers $(m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_s)$. If $r<s$, then the secret key sequence is extended by repeating it as many times as necessary until it matches the length of the message.\n",
    " - Let $c_i$ be the reminder from the division of $m_i + k_i$ by $128$. The sequence of numbers $(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_s)$ is the encrypted message.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the message is `'Top secret!'` and the secret key is `'buffalo'` then the encrypted message is: `[54, 100, 86, 6, 84, 81, 82, 84, 90, 90, 7]`. Let's develop some code that will allow us to perform this encryption ourselves."
