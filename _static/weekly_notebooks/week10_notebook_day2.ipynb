That is, for a given pixel we've hit all color channels together with salt/pepper noise (if they get hit at all). It could also be the case that the color channels are independently affected by \"salt\"/\"pepper\" noise. That is, it might be that the red channel of the `[i,j]`th pixel is hit by salt noise (i.e. set to `1`) while the blue channel of the `[i,j]`th pixel is hit by pepper noise (i.e. set to `0`).
