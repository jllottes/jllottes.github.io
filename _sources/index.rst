Course Resources
----------------

**Laptop.** We will be programming during all class meetings, so you should bring a laptop to every class. 
Any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) is fine.

**Software.** We will be using the `Anaconda distribution of Python 3.9 <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads target="_blank">`_.
This is free software. 
Even if you have Python already installed on your computer you should install this distribution since it includes Jupyter Notebook and several Python libraries we will need.
If you have a previous version of Python installed, please upgrade it so you don't run into possible compatibility issues.

**Textbook.** There is no required textbook. There are a lot of online resources (documentation of Python libraries etc.) that may be helpful in this course. Some of them are listed on the :doc:`Useful Links <useful_links>` page.

|UBLearns| will be used mainly for submitting project reports.

Grading
-------

There will be no exams in this course. Instead, grades will be assigned based on the following components:

    * Project Reports 70%
    * Quizzes 20%
    * Class Participation, 10%


Project Reports
===============

One the main components of this course will be exploratory projects. 
You will be working on them largely independently, using mathematical and computing tools.
The outcome of your work on each project will be a project report that you will submit for grading.

Each report will be graded on the A-F scale. 
Extra credit (a grade of A+) will be assigned for an outstanding work. 
Reports will be submitted via UBLearns. The submission deadline will be 11:59 PM on Mondays.
Late reports will not be accepted. 
Your project report must be original, even if you worked on some components of the project in a group.
More information about project reports is posted :doc:`here <report_guide>`.
The lowest project score will be dropped at the end of the semester.


Quizzes
=======

Each Monday there will be a short quiz testing your knowledge of Python.
Sample quizzes will be posted ahead of time with the :doc:`weekly class schedule <weekly_schedule>`.
The lowest two quiz scores will be dropped.

Class Participation
===================

This includes class attendance, asking and answering questions in class and during office hours.
Class participation will be evaluated weekly.
