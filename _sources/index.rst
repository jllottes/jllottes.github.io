Course Resources
----------------

**Laptop.** We will be programming during all class meetings, so you should bring a laptop to every class. 
Any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) is fine.

**Software.** We will using the `Anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download/success>`__ of Python.
This is free software. 
Even if you have Python already installed on your computer you should install this distribution since it includes Jupyter Notebook and several Python libraries we will need.
If you have a different version of Python installed, please re-install so that you don't run into possible compatibility issues.

Note: You do not need to make any accounts to use Anaconda.
If you do create an account and are using the cloud version of Anaconda, you may run into issues later in the semester.


**Textbook.** There is no required textbook. There are a lot of online resources (documentation of Python libraries etc.) that may be helpful in this course. Some of them are listed on the :doc:`Useful Links <useful_links>` page.

|UBLearns| will be used mainly for submitting Jupyter Notebook files and project reports.

    * Class Participation 10%


Project Reports
===============

The main component of this course will be exploratory projects. 
You will be working on them largely independently, using mathematical and computing tools.
The outcome of your work on each project will be a project report that you will submit for grading.

Each report will be graded on the A-F scale. 
Extra credit will be assigned for outstanding work. 
Reports will be submitted via UBLearns.
Late reports will not be accepted. 
Your project report must be original, even if you worked on some components of the project in a group.
More information about project reports is posted :doc:`here <report_guide>`.
The lowest project score will be dropped at the end of the semester.

.. Comment
    Quizzes
    =======
    Each Wednesday there will be a short quiz testing your knowledge of Python.
    Sample quizzes will be posted ahead of time with the :doc:`weekly class schedule <weekly_schedule>`.
    The lowest two quiz scores will be dropped.

    Class Participation
    ===================
    This includes class attendance, asking and answering questions in class and during office hours, and submitting weekly notebook files.
    Class participation will be evaluated weekly.
    
In-class assignments
====================
There will be regular in-class assignments throughout the semester.
These assignments may include quizzes, code snippets to be completed, explanation/documentation of existing code, etc.

    COVID-19 Information
    ====================
    Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, high-quality masks must be worn at all times during class.  
    If I notice that you do not have a mask on, I will ask you to either put one on or leave the classroom.  
    Please make sure your mask covers both your mouth and nose and fits tightly on your face without gaps between your mask and your
    face.  
    I may ask you to leave the classroom if your mask does not fit tightly.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic integrity is critical to the learning process. 
It is your responsibility as a student to complete your work in an honest fashion, upholding the expectations your individual instructors have for you in this regard. 
The ultimate goal is to ensure that you learn the content in your courses in accordance with UB’s academic integrity principles, regardless of whether instruction is in-person or remote. 
Thank you for upholding your own personal integrity and ensuring UB’s tradition of academic excellence. 
The academic integrity policy is available at:

    `Academic Integrity <https://www.buffalo.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_

All work submitted for this course must be your own. 
As a result, any use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT or Grammarly) is prohibited in this class and will be considered a violation of UB’s academic integrity policy. 
If you are unsure whether a resource or tool is allowable, be sure to ask in advance. 

While you are encouraged to collaborate with your peers to problem solve while working on the projects, each student is responsible for producing an original project report on their own. 
You may be asked to explain in detail what your code does and how it works if there are questions about the integrity of your work.
